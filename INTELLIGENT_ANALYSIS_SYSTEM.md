# Intelligent Story Analysis System

## üéØ **System Overview**

The Intelligent Story Analysis System is the core engine that powers the Cinematic Reading Engine (Cinei-read). It analyzes books intelligently to apply cinematic effects sparingly and meaningfully, maintaining the core philosophy: **"The book is the star."**

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **Core Components**

The system consists of 7 main components that work together in a sophisticated pipeline:

1. **StoryAnalyzer** - Main orchestrator
2. **StoryStructureAnalyzer** - Narrative structure analysis
3. **CharacterEmotionAnalyzer** - Character development tracking
4. **EmotionalIntensityScorer** - Emotional weight calculation
5. **IntelligentEffectSelector** - Context-aware effect selection
6. **EffectQualityController** - Quality validation and filtering
7. **EffectSparsityController** - Sparsity enforcement
