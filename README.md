# Cinematic Reading Engine (Cinei-read)

> **Transform your reading experience with intelligent cinematic enhancements**

A revolutionary digital reading platform that enhances traditional ebooks with intelligent cinematic effects—kinetic typography, atmospheric audio, and thematic visuals—while preserving the fundamental joy of reading.

## 🎯 Vision & Philosophy

### Core Vision
Create a new media format that bridges traditional literature and modern interactive entertainment by integrating subtle, tasteful, and dynamic theatrical elements into digital books.

### Core Philosophy
**The book is the star.** All effects serve as subconscious enhancements to the reader's imagination, never as distractions. Built on "less is more," the most impactful effects are reserved for critical story moments, deepening immersion without disrupting the reading experience.

### Target Audience
- Avid readers who are technologically curious
- Younger audiences accustomed to dynamic digital media
- Anyone seeking a more immersive reading experience

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Client-Server Model
The system separates intensive processing from real-time rendering for optimal performance:

#### 📱 Mobile Client (The Reader)
- **Platform**: React Native (Android first, iOS planned)
- **Purpose**: Upload books, manage library, experience enhanced content
- **Responsibilities**: Parse Cinematic Markup, render effects in real-time
- **Features**: Authentication, library management, immersive reader, settings panel

#### ⚙️ Backend (The Conversion Engine)
- **Framework**: Python with FastAPI
- **Purpose**: Complete analysis and enhancement processing
- **Responsibilities**: Receive ebooks, parse content, apply intelligent effects, return enhanced versions
- **Intelligence**: 7-component analysis pipeline with NLP and machine learning

## 🧠 Intelligent Story Analysis System

### Core Components
The system features a sophisticated 7-component analysis pipeline:

1. **StoryAnalyzer** - Main orchestrator coordinating all analysis
2. **StoryStructureAnalyzer** - Narrative structure and pacing analysis
3. **CharacterEmotionAnalyzer** - Character development and emotional tracking
4. **EmotionalIntensityScorer** - Multi-factor emotional weight calculation
5. **IntelligentEffectSelector** - Context-aware effect selection
6. **EffectQualityController** - Quality validation and filtering
7. **EffectSparsityController** - Sparsity enforcement ("less is more")

### Processing Pipeline
```
Raw Book Content → Structural Analysis → Character Analysis → Emotional Scoring → Effect Selection → Quality Control → Sparsity Control → Enhanced Markup
```

### Key Features
- **Narrative Intelligence**: Identifies story beats, climax points, and emotional arcs
- **Character Profiling**: Tracks character development and emotional states
- **Context Awareness**: Analyzes dialogue patterns and thematic elements
- **Quality Control**: Multi-layer validation ensuring appropriate effect usage
- **Sparsity Enforcement**: Prevents effect overuse through intelligent density control

## 📚 Book Processing Flow

1. **Upload**: `POST /books/upload` with an EPUB file. The server parses the book and runs `StoryAnalyzer.analyze_and_enhance` to generate cinematic markup.
2. **Check Status**: `GET /books/jobs/{job_id}/status` returns `processing` or `completed` for the upload job.
3. **Retrieve Markup**: `GET /books/jobs/{job_id}/result` returns the enhanced cinematic markup once processing is complete.

The processed markup is persisted for later access and library management.
