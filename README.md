# Cinematic Reading Engine

This repository contains the early scaffolding for **Cinei-read**, an MVP
that enhances traditional ebooks with subtle cinematic effects.

## Project Structure
- `backend/` – FastAPI service for uploading EPUBs and generating
  Cinematic Markup.
- `client/` – React Native application for reading enhanced books.
- `model/` – Legacy prototype code (to be refactored).
- `storyboard.py` – Original experiment script (to be revisited).

Both backend and client currently contain placeholder implementations that
will be expanded in future commits.
